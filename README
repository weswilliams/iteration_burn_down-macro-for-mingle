Source includes two mingle macros: iteration_burn_down and release_metrics

* iteration_burn_down

 Create an iteration burndown daily based on iteration start and end dates and accepted story points and accepted date.

Please try this and give me feedback.

uses type Iteration - 'Start Date' and 'End Date' (not configurable)
uses Project Parameter - 'Current Iteration' - overriden with iteration: '#3 Iteration 5' parameter
uses type Story - 'Story Points' and 'Date Accepted' (both configurable) with (story_points: planning_estimate and date_accepted:accepted_on) parameters

ex. using all default values

{{
 iteration_burn_down
}}

ex. overriding defaults (iteration can be THIS CARD if the macro is included in the iteration card description)

{{
  iteration_burn_down
    iteration" '#34 Iteration Name'
    story_points: planning_estimate
    date_accepted: accepted_on
}}



* release_metrics

shows information about the current release

** average velocity for last 3 iterations
** competed iterations
** completed story points
** remaining story points
** iteration length (in days based on the last completed iteration)
** estimates for remaining iteration and end dates based on
*** average velocity for last 3 iterations
*** average velocity for all iterations in the release
*** best velocity
*** worst velocity

If you are using Iteration type with Velocity, Start Date and End Date fields, a Release type with an End Date
 field, and a Current Release project variable then you can use the defaults.

{{
  release_metrics
}}

override the defaults: (note: end_date is used on both the Release and time_box types)

{{
  release_metrics
    time_box: 'sprint'
    release: '#1 Release 1'
    start_date: 'Begin Date'
    end_date: 'Finish Date'
    velocity: 'Completed Story Estimate Sum'
}}
